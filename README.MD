Sure! Here's an example of what a README file for this program could look like:

# Programming Language Tracker

This is a simple Python program that allows users to add programming languages to a list, track the number of times each language has been added, and remove languages from the list. The program uses a JSON file to store the list of programming languages and their counts, so the data is persistent between program runs.

## Requirements

To run this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the files to your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are located.
3. Run the `language_tracker.py` file using the command `python language_tracker.py`.
4. Follow the prompts to add or remove programming languages, list the current languages and their counts, or quit the program.

The program will save the list of programming languages and their counts to a file called `languages.json` in the same directory as the program. If you delete this file, the program will create a new one the next time it is run.
